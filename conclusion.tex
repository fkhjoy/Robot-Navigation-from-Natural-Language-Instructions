\chapter{Conclusion}
Our language processing task also have needed some fundamental modifications. We still worked with English language but we hope to work for Bengali language. Processing Bengali language in a computational environment is a challenging task. We've have to work with unicode. As Bengali language have more difficult syntax then English language so one of our core challenging task still remain.\\

Further its difficult to work with Bengali language as there are not enough Bengali language datasets for such computational tasks. We might have to make our own dataset for training the fundamental models that we've used in this task.\\

For processing Language and extracting necessary information in this case, determining which is desired destination in a given natural language instruction we used very basic machine learning model without any hyper-parameter tuning. So we didn't get enough good result but we hope to use more advance models or neural networks that we still didn't explore much.\\

We worked with basic reinforcement learning algorithm which is not much efficient that we aimed for this project. In the upcoming advance version of this project, we aim to deploy one or more machine learning models to generate necessary navigation commands from given natural language instruction.\\

The reinforcement learning algorithm that we've used here, in a known environment it works properly and efficiently. But with the increase of environment this algorithms becomes slower. So for a complex environment this algorithm is not much suitable. As our environment is still not much complex so our algorithm will work properly here.\\

Our simulation environment is still very simple and we used this currently for demonstration purpose only. This environment represents nothing of real life. We aim to design an environment that'll capable of represents a real life environment.\\

We've studied several papers and tested various technical issues. So apparently our task seems very simple but the implication of our endeavor will be visible very soon.
