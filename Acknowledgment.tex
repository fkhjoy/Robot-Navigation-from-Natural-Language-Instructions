Thanking is the best way to appreciate ourself for performing a great task. The reason We can claim that We are successful in completing our work with such ease is that the Almighty gave us the ability, capability, chance, cooperating hands, and enough stamina to walk on this path. Almighty enriched us with very good luck on this path of work.
\par The reason We are talking about luck is that We had our respected teacher Sujan Sarker as our supervisor in this work and We would like to take the opportunity to express our sincere gratitude and indebtedness to our respected supervisor. Although he is a self-motivated and hard-working person always loaded with research and administrative works, he gave us more than enough time in this work.
