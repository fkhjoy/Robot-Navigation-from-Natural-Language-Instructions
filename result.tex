\chapter{Result}
For multi-label text classification there are some few models that can be used properly. In our dataset, we have eleven different classes to classify. So for our classification task, we tried three traditional classification models. They are:\\

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Multinomial Naive Bayes
    \item Logistic Regression
    \item Linear Support Vector Machine
\end{enumerate}

As mentioned earlier, we have eleven different classes they are: Black Box, Green Box, Blue Box, Yellow Box, Cyan Box, Green circle, Yellow Circle, Blue Circle, Green Triangle, Yellow Triangle and Blue Triangle. We measure accuracy of our classification using basic accuracy measurement. The comparative accuracy of classification of above mentioned model are as follow:\\

So from the above table we can easily see that Linear Support Vector Classifier give us much more accuracy than any other models.\\

A bar plot visualization of accuracy among various models is given below:

We still didn't try some other models and some other hyper-parameter for Linear SVC.
