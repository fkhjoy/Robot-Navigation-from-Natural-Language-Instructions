	\section{Comparison Altogether}
	Lets have look on both of these model and their accuracy altogether. \\
	
	\begin{table}[H]
		\centering
		\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
			\hline
			Accuracy Type \textbackslash Model & LSTM    & RNN     & GRU     \\ \hline
			Train Accuracy                     & 89.72\% & 57.53\% & 83.59\% \\ \hline
			Validation Accuracy                & 97.78\% & 63.00\% & 37.30\% \\ \hline

	\end{table}
	
	The table above shows various accuracy comparison between various models. And we can easily see that LSTM is the obvious champion here.
